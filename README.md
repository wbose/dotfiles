# Dotfiles

Welcome to my personal dotfiles repository! This repository contains configurations for various tools and applications that shape my Linux environment. It’s tailored to my needs and preferences, so it might not suit everyone, but I hope you find some inspiration here.

## What's Included

- **Window Manager, Terminal, and Status Bar**:
  - **dwm** (Dynamic Window Manager), **st** (Simple Terminal), and **dwmblocks** are customized versions based on the great work of [Luke Smith](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz). For more details, check out his repositories:

    - [dmenu](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/dmenu)
  - **lf** (List Files) - A terminal file manager, with configurations inspired by [lf](https://github.com/gokcehan/lf).

- **Text Editor**:
  - **Neovim** - My preferred editor, enhanced with [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim), a configuration framework to streamline the Neovim setup.
